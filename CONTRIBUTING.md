# Kiwi Development Guidelines 👨‍💻

## Folder structure 🪛

- `.github` contains CI workflows to build Kiwi
- `backend` contains the code of the REST API backend, written in Rust
- `ci` contains a composite Github Action to deploy services to a Kiwi instance
- `web` contains the code of the web app, written in TypeScript using SolidJS and Park UI

## Setup 🪛

### General 🥝

You will access your local server through a test domain, `kiwi-local.com`. To make it point to your local machine, add the following entries to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
# Kiwi development environment
127.0.0.1       kiwi-local.com                  # main domain
127.0.0.1       auth.kiwi-local.com             # auth service
127.0.0.1       admin.kiwi-local.com            # admin service
127.0.0.1       ci.kiwi-local.com               # ci service
127.0.0.1       status.kiwi-local.com           # status service
127.0.0.1       test-service-1.kiwi-local.com   # test service
```

You can add other lines like `127.0.0.1       test-service-2.kiwi-local.com   # test service`, they will be useful to test registered services within Kiwi.

### Web 🕷️

1. Install `fnm` ([guide](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm))

1. Install the latest Node.js version:

   ```sh
   fnm install --latest --corepack-enabled
   fnm use <INSTALLED_VERSION>
   ```

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`

### Backend 🎒

1. Install Docker ([guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Run Locally 🧸

### Web 🕷️

```sh
pnpm dev
```

If you run the frontend only, you can access it at `http://<service>.kiwi-local.com:3000/<path>`.

### Backend 🎒

```sh
cargo run
```

The backend service is available at `https://<service>.kiwi-local.com:5000/<path>` and also serves the frontend pages.

Please note that only HTTPS is supported by the backend, and any attempt to access an `http://` URL will give invalid response. Your browser will initially show a warning due to untrusted certificates, as the backend generates dummy ones if it doesn't find some.

## Lint and Format 🧽

### Web 🕷️

```sh
pnpm lint
```

### Backend 🎒

```sh
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- --deny warnings
```
